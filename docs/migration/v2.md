title: Upgrading to version 2
sidebar_label: Version 2
---

Here are the following instruction to upgrade from version 1 to version 2.

## Installation
```bash
npm install typefs-s3-driver@^2.0.0
```


## High Impact Changes

### Issue 210

In order to keep bundle sizes and memory requirements to a minimum, disk drivers will live in separate npm packages. This ensures that you only build the disk drivers you use, which is important for deploying to on demand compute functions.

#### Breaking change
The S3 driver has been moved from the type-fs package to typefs-s3-driver.

#### Solution

If you are using the S3 disk driver, you will need to run

```bash
npm install typefs-s3-driver
```

then you must register the driver with the Storage manager.

```typescript
// index.ts
import { Storage } from 'typefs;
import { S3Factory } from 'typefs-s3-driver';

Storage.registerDriver('s3', S3Factory));

Storage.config: Configuration = {
  default: 's3',
  disks: [
    s3: {
            driver: 's3',
            root: '/',
            jail: true,
            "bucket": process.env.S3_BUCKET || 'my-s3-bucket',
            "endPoint": process.env.S3_ENDPOINT || 's3.amazonaws.com',
            "accessKey": process.env.S3_ACCESS_KEY || 'minio-access-key',
            "secretKey": process.env.S3_SECRET_KEY || 'minio-secret-key',
        }
  ]
// ...
}
```
